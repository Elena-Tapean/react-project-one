Since then I have learned similar words like “node.js”, “npm/npx” and \"nodemon\", etc. Since my background is in Literature (I used to work as a translator and proofreading editor for an intercultural literary journal), it was quite easy for me to understand the true frontend requirements. I have worked on multiple projects using both React.js and Vue.js.</i>"},"soft_skills":{"title":"SOFT SKILLS","details":"<i>Active Listening<br/>\n                Teamwork<br/>\n                Optimism<br/>\n                Problem-solving</i>"},"special_skills":{"title":"SPECIAL SKILLS","details":"<i>I have a keen eye for details.
